# string-finder
A simple bash script to help me search through files for a specific string.

filetype and string are both configurable, plan to add functionality to specify these without re-coding anything.

At the moment it's very basic. runs through any .psc files contained in the folder you run it against, and will report if the specified string is found. If any are discovered, will say how many times and in which script the string was found in.
